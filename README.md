JSoftFloat
----------

JSoftFloat aims to be a compliant implementation of the the [IEEE 754-2008 standard](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4610935/)
Its still a major work in progress though; there are major parts of the standard
which are not implemented yet. Decimal floats and logrithms have not
been implemented yet.

This was initially made for use in [RARS](https://thethirdone/rars), but could certainly be useful for any applicationm where strict adherance to the standard and/or deterministic floatin point computation is needed.
## Bugs

If the standard disagrees with how JSoftFloat handles something, it is a bug. If
you submit an issue with an example and a quote from the standard, it should be
addressed in a timely manner. 

Suggestions from the specification that are not followed are not bugs, but a Pull
request which fufills a suggestion would be appreciated.
